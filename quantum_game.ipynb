        "In this project we create a new quantum implementation of Snakes and Ladders to compete with a classical player and demonstrate a quantum advantage.  We use the Qiskit programming language to create a board represented by a basis of 4 qubits that the quantum player can travel through in a superposition of paths. We then utilize a generalization of Grover's Algorithm to amplify the amplitudes of the leading paths.\n",

        "Though we start with a 16 square board with two ladders and two snakes, this can be generalized to arbitrary boards with varying levels of quantum advantage over a classical player, representing different levels of difficulty."
